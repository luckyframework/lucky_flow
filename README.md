# LuckyFlow

LuckyFlow is a library for testing user flows in the browser. It is similar to
Ruby's Capybara.

## Installation in [Lucky](https://luckyframework.org) projects

LuckyFlow is already installed and configured. Check out the guides
to see how to use it: https://luckyframework.org/guides/browser-tests/

## Installation in other Crystal projects

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
development_dependencies:
  lucky_flow:
    github: luckyframework/lucky_flow
```

Configure LuckyFlow in `spec/spec_helper.cr`:

```crystal
require "lucky_flow"

LuckyFlow.configure do
  # This is required
  settings.base_uri = "http://localhost:<port>"

  # Optional settings. Defaults are shown here
  settings.retry_delay = 10.milliseconds
  settings.stop_retrying_after = 1.second
  settings.screenshot_directory = "./tmp/screenshots"
end

# Put this at the bottom of the filejjj.
# If a required setting is missing, this will catch it.
Habitat.raise_if_missing_settings!
```

Then install Chromedriver and view the guides: https://luckyframework.org/guides/browser-tests/

You should be ready to go!

## Usage

> Note that you can only pass string paths to `visit` since only Lucky has
> route helpers described in the guide below. Example: `visit "/my-path"`
